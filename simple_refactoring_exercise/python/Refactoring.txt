For the simple refactoring exercise I chose Python because I find myself more familiar with Python
and to be consistent with the language chosen for simple collection process exercise.

1) The Rakefile is Ruby file used for automating tasks mainly in Ruby on Rails.

2) The README.md file markdown file with text.

3) I refactored the code in "template.py" and "template_test.py" files as follows:
    template.py
    Since the existing code was manipulating and modifying strings, I decided to use string formatting by utilising "str.format()" method.
    As refactoring often involves removing unnecessary code or redundant code, I removed some of the existing code to work on the "req-id" parameter.

    template_test.py
    Replaced the "%CODE%" and "%ALTCODE%" in the assertEqual() method to "{CODE}" and "{ALTCODE}" as we are using "str.format()".
    Removed the "setup()" as it was not doing anything in the given code.
    With all these changes, the unit test passes successfully.
