Directions:
I have included both .py and .ipynb files, both achieve the same result except that with jupyter notebook, we can work on bits of code
more easily as we can execute few line and keep its result saved for further processing. For instance, during the test, with jupyter notebooks
one would not have to keep requesting website for the content. Below are the instructions that are common to both .py and .ipynb files.

Tools used for the project:
Python 2.7.13, PyCharm IDE, Jupyter Notebook, Git Bash, GitHub

1) Install python 2.7.+ on the machine you are running this script or notebook.
2) Install BeautifulSoup library with: pip install bs4
    Install Pandas library with : pip install pandas
    Install requests library with : pip install requests

For WebScrapper.py:
In terminal/ git-bash navigate to the directory in which the WebScrapper.py file is present and run the command :
python ./WebScrapper.py

There should be no errors, but if there are then try changing the permissions to the WebScrapper.py file with 'chmod' command.
Running the script will generate 2 files: 'ofile.csv' and 'DOLRuling.jpg'

ofile.csv contains the blog details from the link - http://ifpartners.com/cut-the-wire/ with information
Title, Updated Time, Author, Content and Banner href

DOLRuling.jpg is the first image on the website saved to local file system.


For WebScrapper.ipynb:
In addition to the libraries mentioned above add jupyter libraraies with following command:
pip install jupyter

Navigate to the directory in which the WebScrapper.ipynb file is present
Start the Jupyter Notebook with command : 'jupyter notebook'
A tab will open in the browser with files in the directory. Open 'WebScrapper.ipynb' and run each block with by hitting 'Ctrl+ Enter'

Running all the blocks will generate 2 files: 'ipynb_ofile.csv' and 'ipynb_DOLRuling.jpg'

ipynb_ofile.csv contains the blog details from the link - http://ifpartners.com/cut-the-wire/ with information
Title, Updated Time, Author, Content and Banner href

ipynb_DOLRuling.jpg is the first image on the website saved to local file system.
